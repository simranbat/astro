[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Ok, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car note, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nose bleeds (alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever got a whole week (alright, alright, alright)
But she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, I feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
You feel me?"

Hit my eses, I need the booch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke (don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said ""Where we goin'?"" I said ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (someone said)

STOP TRYING TO BE GOD,"[Intro]
This is the real action, the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers
The hip ones, all gathered in secrecy
And flying high as a kite

Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air that can break your heart

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (ooh-ooh)
The signal's far from what you can be (ooh-ooh)
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, you bet not try to play God tonight
If I love her I'ma pass her one
First rule of war, you find an act of one
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love me but want to really burn me

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long
Since the last open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the net
Just let this wash on me
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (wash on me, wash on me, yeah)

YOSEMITE,"[Chorus: Gunna]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In The Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, say it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Couple of angels is watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10, but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Pateks
In The Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Outro: NAV]
La Flame on a island, me and Cash Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Prada's every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking where the codeine at
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet"

Bad-bad news
I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between, yeah (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back, back in the bathroom line (this is all)

[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I had you?
Trust me, you would be mad too
Shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move
Plus, I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking in mad mins
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
(This is all, this is all)

[Chorus]
Back of the coffee line
Back-back, yeah, back in the bathroom line (this is-)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you
Don't worry, I'll be back for you
All the money and cars, stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean reflecting on all you see
(This is all, this is all)

[Verse 2]
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (this is all)
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope
Some shit only me and the Lord knows
SOS, that's for those who hear this in morse code
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and foreign doors
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes
This shit'll have you in divorce court
Fighting over your seeds
Writing over your deeds, sliding over your keys
Alimony and fees
As your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news

[Chorus]
I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean anything in between

Back-back, back in the bathroom line (this is all)"
